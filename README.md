## Completed project repo
Due to issues with pushing file to this repo, the completed project has been moved to a newer repo. 

Completed repo: https://github.com/6hrslater/jungle-rails-remake

Reason for moving repos: I wasn't able to pull / push files and did not notice until a bunch of commits were missed so I had to manually add files to the repo which has caused some issues with files being in the wrong directories etc. A new repo was made for the completed project to avoid the complexity and this repo can be for references to the completed one.

# Jungle

A mini e-commerce application built with Rails 6.1 for purposes of teaching Rails by example.

## Setup

1. Run `bundle install` to install dependencies
2. Create `config/database.yml` by copying `config/database.example.yml`
3. Create `config/secrets.yml` by copying `config/secrets.example.yml`
4. Run `bin/rails db:reset` to create, load and seed db
5. Create .env file based on .env.example
6. Sign up for a Stripe account
7. Put Stripe (test) keys into appropriate .env vars
8. Run `bin/rails s -b 0.0.0.0` to start the server

## Database

If Rails is complaining about authentication to the database, uncomment the user and password fields from `config/database.yml` in the development and test sections, and replace if necessary the user and password `development` to an existing database user.

## Stripe Testing

Use Credit Card # 4111 1111 1111 1111 for testing success scenarios.
